For this game of Leap Frog Parkour Masters, I added two platforms at either end of the arena, with one tower in the middle with the biggest obstacle of all, the Spin Log.
The spin log is a deterrant to other players who want to rush their opponent off the bat. The log can be bounced on top of, and if used skillfully, the player bouncing and use it to rack up points against the opponent. The game has potential to be more fun, but these were the added game design tools to improve the game.
