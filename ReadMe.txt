For this game of Leap Frog Parkour Masters, I added two platforms at either end of the arena, with one tower in the middle with the biggest obstacle of all, the Spin Log.
The spin log is a deterrant to other players who want to rush their opponent off the bat. The log can be bounced on top of, and if used skillfully, the player bouncing and use it to rack up points against the opponent. The game has potential to be more fun, but these were the added game design tools to improve the game.

The changes I made to the game were substantial to the game and fixed many issues
- Fixed the detection of triggers by creating new boxes that hold the triggers and not the actual player colliders.
- Fixed the way the game counts scores so that way the scores don't get counted in twos or a million times.
- Added better UI that reflects the game state and such.
- The points being shown accurately reflect who is scoring the point, no longer will player one score for player 2.
